# Handling-Missing-Values-in-Python

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Objective
The objective of this case study is to detect missing values and then go over some of the methods used for imputing them. And after imputing with an appropriate method will move to model prediction to check that is this imputing operation will play important role in model accuracy or not.

So here we are going to import the üö¢ titanic dataset Non-Time Series problem and üå¶Ô∏è Air Quality Data for Time Series problem.

## üìë Contents
### 1. Data
### 2. Loading necessary libraries and datasets
### 3. Reading in the dataset
### 4. Examining the Target column
### 5. Detecting Missing values
### 6. Detecting missing data visually using Missingno library
### 7. Finding Missing data using Matrix plot
### 8. Finding Missing data using a Heatmap
### 9. Finding Missing data using Dendrogram
### 10. Treating Missing values
 - 10.1 Deletions
 - 10.2 Dropping complete columns
 - Basic Imputation Techniques
 - 10.3 K-Nearest Neighbor Imputation
### 11. Imputations Techniques for Time Series Problems
 - 11.1 Imputing using ffill
 - 11.2 Imputation using bfill
 - 11.3 Imputation using Linear Interpolation method
### 12. Now Let‚Äôs predict the model accuracy by using various imputation techniques.
 - Logistic regression.
 - 12.1 Deleting the column with missing data
 - 12.2 Deleting the row with missing data
 - 12.3 Filling the Missing Values ‚Äì Imputation
 - 12.4 Filling with a Regression Model
