# Handling-Missing-Values-in-Python

## Objective
The objective of this case study is to detect missing values and then go over some of the methods used for imputing them. And after imputing with an appropriate method will move to model prediction to check that is this imputing operation will play important role in model accuracy or not.

So here we are going to import the titanic dataset Non-Time Series problem and Air Quality Data for Time Series problem.
